# MazeGen

Kotlin maze generator console application. 

This was a private weekend project just for learning Kotlin. The code is ugly, dirty, messy, ... you name it. However it was fun to create learn Kotlin and in the same moment create a "useful" (well... more useful than an ordinary exercise programm) programm in a hckathonish way. So the code formatting, code stlye in general, comments, "architecture" and so on are everything else than impressive.

* Open `maze.html` with your browser to see a generated maze
* I believe that the exit position can be blocked, consider it a bug
* There are two "printers", a HTML printer (currently active) and a text file / console / ASCII art printer that might have at least one bug
* There is a lot of unused code in the .kt file
